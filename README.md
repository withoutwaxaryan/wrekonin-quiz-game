A noir quiz-hangman game in Turbo C++ !

![DEMO](https://media.giphy.com/media/3h0R8BzGltd7CJxaAY/giphy.gif)

Find the full demo [here](https://youtu.be/K4vPp9tS9O4).

**Developers** : Akash Savio Sen & Aryan Gupta (2016)

**Theme** : A quiz game- hangman, where the main guy (Rick) has to reckon the right answer or he will get wrecked!


Note : The source code only runs on the wildly ancient MS DOS BOX Turbo C++. For curious cats, you can download it from [here](https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/) (only for Windows).


## To run the game : 

* Clone the repo
* Install Turbo C++
* Copy the cpp and dat file to `C:\TurboC4\TC\BIN`
* Open the cpp file in turbo C++, Compile(`Alt + F9`) and run (`Ctrl + F9`)
* Enjoy!

P.S. (`Alt + x`) to exit DOS Box :P
